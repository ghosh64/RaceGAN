insert weight path, result path in main.py
run main.py to train the model.

Train using main.py and save weights using weight path. 
During inference, use the trained weights to predict, and then perform the erosion and dilation operations as in test.py. You must specify the trained weight paths in the test.py to accurately test the model.

specify result_path in test.py
